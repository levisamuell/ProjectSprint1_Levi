### Project Scope

**Main Goal**: Our primary goal for this sprint is to build a simple, interactive web-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with support from GitHub Copilot. The focus is on learning prompt-based development and understanding how Copilot can assist in generating code effectively.


**Key Features & Deliverables:**


- A functional game interface (e.g., rock paper scissors)
- 
- 
- Game logic (input handling, scoring, feedback system)
- 
- 
- UI styling using CSS for a user-friendly experience
- 
- 
- GitHub Copilot-powered code contributions across HTML, CSS, and JS
- 
- 
- A working demo with basic interactivity for the mid-sprint presentation


### Milestones and Timeline

**Session 1 - Sprint Planning:**

Finalized the game concept, assigned roles, and decided on tech stack.

**By "Game Structure with Copilot":**
We aim to have the core logic mapped out using Copilot, including all key functions stubbed and game flow planned.


**By "UI Styling Session":** Complete basic HTML layout and apply CSS for visual elements such as buttons, text, and game area.


**By "Mid-Sprint Demo + Feedback":**
Present a working version of the game with at least one playable level or complete round.


**Final Sprint Session:** Polish the UI, fix bugs, enhance gameplay experience, and prepare for final submission/demo.



### Team Roles and Responsibilities

Sera Shine(Me):




**Teammate 1 : Levi Samuel:** Works on HTML structure, assists with CSS, JS and prompt generation for Copilot.

**Teammate 2 Sera Shine:** Handles CSS styling and visual design of the interface.

**Teammate 3 Issac Antony:** Focus on game logic implementation using JavaScript and Copilot. Also responsible for integrating Copilot suggestions into clean, readable code.

**Teammate 4 John Robert:** Coordinates GitHub commits, manages Copilot-generated suggestions, and ensures prompt documentation.


**Role Strategy:** Roles will remain mostly fixed for efficiency, but we will rotate for peer review and support when someone finishes early or gets blocked.


**Communication & Coordination:**

We plan to use a shared Google Doc for planning and G-Meet for daily check-ins. Code will be pushed to GitHub with proper commit messages and branches.



### Anticipated Challenges and Strategies

**Challenge 1: Overreliance on Copilot :**  
Strategy: We'll ensure that every Copilot-generated snippet is reviewed, debugged, and fully understood before integrating it into the project.


**Challenge 2: Time Management :**  
Strategy: Weekly milestones will help us stay on track. Each member has committed to dedicating focused hours outside class sessions.


**Challenge 3: Merge Conflicts or Code Duplication:**  
Strategy: Weâ€™ll assign clear sections to each member and merge only after peer reviews. GitHub pull requests and branches will be used to minimize conflicts.


**Challenge 4: Miscommunication or Misalignment**  
Strategy: Daily 5-minute check-ins via chat and one fixed weekly call for syncing progress and blockers.
